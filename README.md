### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises,
but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a
small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing
your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to
architect, design, and collaboratively build an application of your own design.

While your last project taught you how to get started with Ruby, SQL, & Ruby on
Rails, this project you'll be building something exciting with
**Express & Mongo.**

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot
harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what
you’re going to find yourself doing in your first development job after WDI,
and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Use Mongo & Express** to build an app with a RESTful interface
- **Models**:
    - **Use at least 2 models**, one of which should be a "user," and one
      which is represents your resource
    - Include **all major CRUD functions** on your resource model(s)
- **Add authentication to your app** to restrict access to appropriate users
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible

It is suggested that:

- Your server-side application serves a RESTful, JSON API, and has a
  client-side application that consumes it

---

### Necessary Deliverables

- **Thoughtful user stories**, with their current status ("Assigned to", "Done",
  "Icebox") available on Trello
    - Add your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your
      application
    - You may also add information about your data schema / ERDs (let us know
      if your data model gets complicated!)
- A **working app, hosted somewhere on the internet**
- **A consistent code style.** Make sure it looks like a unified effort!
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted
  project, and frequent commits
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- **A `README.md` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - **A link to your Trello!**
    - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

---

### Team Structure

- Every team needs a manager. That manager will create the Trello Board, GitHub
  repo, and Heroku account, and add the rest of the team (or allow them to fork).
- [Remember our Git / GitHub workflow.](/resources/cheatsheets/class_git_cheatsheet.md#our-workflows)
- Consistency and style:
    - The manager is in charge of ensuring that code meets the team's style and
      commenting rules before merging.
    - The team may want to review the code as a group before or after it is
      merged, in a [Code Review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review)...
      You may ask to use the projector to do this!
- You may work singularly, or in pairs. If you are pairing, remember that it's
  two people, but **ONE computer!**
- When deciding on what you want to work on, it may make sense to choose to work
  on a part of the application you:

    1.  want to get better at doing, or
    2.  enjoy doing and feel comfortable with.

  Either of these is fine! Decide as a team how to divy up the work. It may be
  worthwhile to pair people based on their level of understanding (stronger/weaker)
  on a given feature.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Before you begin writing the app:
    - Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use
      **FIRST**, before you begin to integrate them into your app. Make sure you
      can use them!
    - **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
      focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- When you're writing the app:
    - **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic
      of something helps.
    - **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
    - **Write your code DRYly** and **build your interface RESTfully**.
    - **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
      you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- Remember to use good style and comments:
    - **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
      naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your
      app and understand what everything is?
    - **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block
      or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone
      else can pick it up and get it.
    - **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find
      the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?

### Potential Project Ideas

For this project, we want you to work with your team to build a creative product
that you actually think someone will want to use. We won't have time to do tons
of customer research, but take some time to brainstorm. If you're struggling for
ideas, the ones below could help get you started.

##### Bucketli.st

Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with
your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party
location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to
their bucket list items.

##### Survey App

Imagine sending out a survey to everyone in the class – what should we eat for
lunch today? Or 1-5, how well did you understand what we just learned? It would
be even more awesome if it were real-time, so you could see answers pouring in
as they're submitted.

##### Hello, Comments

Imagine the benefits of having an API where you could embed comments into any
website you want. They could even update in realtime if you wanted, so that
you'd never have to refresh the page. CMS providers across the world could
quit writing code from scratch and just embed your widget instead.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task
  tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as
  expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

- __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the
  technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build
  something that was reasonably complex?

- __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your
  project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not
  just a login button and an index page)?

- __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
  covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you
  comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

- __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution
  in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative
  implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take
  place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've
  completed the project.)_

- __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project
  between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Did not complete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project
 goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which
 can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
